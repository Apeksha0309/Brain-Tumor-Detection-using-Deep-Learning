# Brain-Tumor-Detection-using-Deep-Learning
This project leverages CNN-based deep learning models to classify MRI scans as tumor-positive or tumor-negative. The dataset was preprocessed using OpenCV, NumPy, and Pandas, and the model was trained using TensorFlow/Keras. The implementation includes data augmentation, evaluation metrics, and visualization of predictions.

Technologies Used: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib.
